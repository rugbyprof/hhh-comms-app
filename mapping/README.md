# Mapping

I learned a bit researching these. Most I knew, but some others I did not (ubers and kepler for sure). One or more of these visulization libraries will help us display the routes in the app. Leaflet is a promising library for the visualization, but its been a while. The problem is "you get what you pay for", so open source and free mapping layers tend to look free (IMHO). For anyone interested, research the popularity and usecases for these. It'll help us make a good decision. OR, one of you gets so awesome at 1 of these, we just let you take over mapping :)

## Spatial Data Visualization

### 1. Google Maps (JavaScript API)

Google Maps is a powerful tool for visualizing geographic data, including coordinates and GeoJSON.

- **How to visualize lat/lon coordinates**:
  You can plot coordinates on a Google Map using the **Google Maps JavaScript API**.

  **Example:**

  ```html
  <script src="https://maps.googleapis.com/maps/api/js?key=YOUR_API_KEY"></script>
  <script>
    function initMap() {
      var location = { lat: 37.7749, lng: -122.4194 }; // Example Lat/Lon
      var map = new google.maps.Map(document.getElementById("map"), {
        zoom: 12,
        center: location,
      });
      var marker = new google.maps.Marker({
        position: location,
        map: map,
      });
    }
  </script>
  <div id="map" style="height:500px;width:100%;"></div>
  <body onload="initMap()"></body>
  ```

- **How to visualize GeoJSON**:
  Google Maps can directly handle GeoJSON data using the `Data` layer. You can load GeoJSON data and display it on the map.

  **Example**:

  ```javascript
  map.data.loadGeoJson("path_to_your_geojson_file.json");
  ```

**Documentation**: [Google Maps JavaScript API](https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/javascript/overview)

### 2. Leaflet.js

**Leaflet.js** is a popular open-source JavaScript library for interactive maps. It is lightweight, customizable, and integrates well with a variety of map tile providers.

- **How to visualize lat/lon coordinates**:
  You can easily plot markers on a Leaflet map by creating a `L.map()` and adding markers.

  **Example**:

  ```html
  <div id="map" style="height: 500px;"></div>
  <script>
    var map = L.map("map").setView([37.7749, -122.4194], 13); // Lat/Lon

    L.tileLayer("https://{s}.tile.openstreetmap.org/{z}/{x}/{y}.png", {
      maxZoom: 18,
    }).addTo(map);

    L.marker([37.7749, -122.4194])
      .addTo(map)
      .bindPopup("San Francisco")
      .openPopup();
  </script>
  ```

- **How to visualize GeoJSON**:
  Leaflet can easily handle GeoJSON data and offers built-in functionality for rendering it on a map.

  **Example**:

  ```javascript
  var geojsonFeature = {
    type: "Feature",
    geometry: {
      type: "Point",
      coordinates: [-122.4194, 37.7749],
    },
    properties: {
      name: "San Francisco",
    },
  };

  L.geoJSON(geojsonFeature).addTo(map);
  ```

**Documentation**: [Leaflet.js Documentation](https://leafletjs.com/)

### 3. Mapbox

**Mapbox** provides high-quality, customizable maps, and supports advanced data visualizations with both lat/lon coordinates and GeoJSON data. It comes with a JavaScript library, **Mapbox GL JS**, for easy integration.

- **How to visualize lat/lon coordinates**:
  You can add points on the map using lat/lon coordinates.

  **Example**:

  ```html
  <div id="map" style="height: 500px;"></div>
  <script>
    mapboxgl.accessToken = "YOUR_MAPBOX_ACCESS_TOKEN";
    var map = new mapboxgl.Map({
      container: "map",
      style: "mapbox://styles/mapbox/streets-v11",
      center: [-122.4194, 37.7749], // Starting position [lng, lat]
      zoom: 13,
    });

    var marker = new mapboxgl.Marker()
      .setLngLat([-122.4194, 37.7749])
      .addTo(map);
  </script>
  ```

- **How to visualize GeoJSON**:
  You can load GeoJSON data and visualize it on a Mapbox map.

  **Example**:

  ```javascript
  map.on("load", function () {
    map.addSource("places", {
      type: "geojson",
      data: "path_to_your_geojson_file.json",
    });

    map.addLayer({
      id: "places",
      type: "circle",
      source: "places",
      paint: {
        "circle-radius": 6,
        "circle-color": "#B42222",
      },
    });
  });
  ```

### 4. Kepler.gl (Open Source from Uber)

**Kepler.gl** is a web-based tool from Uber that is perfect for visualizing large-scale geospatial datasets. It supports CSVs, GeoJSON, and more complex data types. It requires no coding, making it easy to quickly upload and visualize your data.

- **How to visualize GeoJSON**:
  You can directly upload GeoJSON files to Kepler.gl and visualize them as points, polygons, or lines.

**Website**: [Kepler.gl](https://kepler.gl/)

### 5. QGIS (Desktop Application)

**QGIS** is an open-source desktop application for geographic information system (GIS) analysis. It supports both latitude/longitude coordinates and GeoJSON and is great for detailed geospatial analysis and visualizations.

- **How to visualize lat/lon coordinates**:
  You can manually import a CSV file containing lat/lon data into QGIS and visualize it on a map.
- **How to visualize GeoJSON**:
  GeoJSON files can be directly opened and visualized in QGIS.

**Website**: [QGIS](https://www.qgis.org/en/site/)

### 6. OpenLayers

**OpenLayers** is an open-source JavaScript library that provides the ability to visualize geospatial data in a browser.

- **How to visualize lat/lon coordinates**:
  OpenLayers allows you to create a map and add layers of lat/lon coordinates.

  **Example**:

  ```javascript
  var map = new ol.Map({
    target: "map",
    layers: [
      new ol.layer.Tile({
        source: new ol.source.OSM(),
      }),
    ],
    view: new ol.View({
      center: ol.proj.fromLonLat([-122.4194, 37.7749]),
      zoom: 13,
    }),
  });

  var marker = new ol.Feature({
    geometry: new ol.geom.Point(ol.proj.fromLonLat([-122.4194, 37.7749])),
  });
  ```

- **How to visualize GeoJSON**:
  You can load GeoJSON data directly into OpenLayers and display it as features.

**Documentation**: [OpenLayers Documentation](https://openlayers.org/)

### 7. Deck.gl (by Uber)

**Deck.gl** is another powerful, open-source WebGL-powered library for large-scale data visualization, with built-in support for geospatial data like lat/lon coordinates and GeoJSON.

- **How to visualize lat/lon coordinates**:
  You can use the **ScatterplotLayer** in Deck.gl to visualize coordinates.

- **How to visualize GeoJSON**:
  Use the **GeoJsonLayer** to visualize complex geographical data.

**Documentation**: [Deck.gl Documentation](https://deck.gl/)

There is some overlap with the above libraries, which is actually good. I'm not sure if we will need routing to "fix" some of our data, but we might. Using the same library for both would be quicker.

Also, not all of these are free. Some are free up to a certain number of requests. So, if you decide to put your credit card in, be careful! Always check, or shutdown your account when done.
