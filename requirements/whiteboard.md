### Initial App Features
1. Location tracking to show volunteer and coordinator locations on course in real time (Google Maps API + overlays?)
2. All app users locations visible to each other and to dispatch.
3. Ability for all to filter dots on map to show only certain roles (e.g. show only SAG or medics.)
4. All volunteers log into app with credentials assigned by HHH
5. Race course highlight/waypoints on map for wayfinding (filterable as well.)
6. A "dispatch" view that shows volunteer phone numbers for direction contact if needed.
7. A "rider" view, no login needed, that could show route highlight, rest stop locations, etc. Also a "contact dispatch" button that would dial a phone # for emergencies.

### Future App Ideas
1. Ability for volunteers or dispatch to message through app to eachother (instant message type function)
And/or
2. Ability to PTT/Chirp voice mesasges to eachother or dispatch through
3. These two functions would "pop up" in app for volunteers and have to be acknowledged to dismiss. This would act as an acknowledgement to sender or dispatcher. Dispatcher view would have a queue for multiple pending messages.
4. Ability to scan QR code on rider's bib to "check them out" if they quit. Info sent back to database, viewable by dispatch. Also modifiable by volunteer that checked them out. (cancel, change dropout location, etc.)
