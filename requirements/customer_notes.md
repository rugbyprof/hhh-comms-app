### Future Features

They also had an idea for the future version of the app for volunteers or dispatch to be able to report an accident / crash and it become a visible, non hide-able POI on everyone's map until it's removed by dispatch. Maybe a button in the "options" menu of the app to "REPORT ACCIDENT AT MY LOCATION". This may require some fine tuning and is just informational for the later version of the app.
